"""
implement a program that prompts the user for their date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format 
and then sings prints how old they are in minutes, rounded to the nearest integer, using 
English words instead of numerals, just like the song from Rent, without any and between words. 
Since a user might not know the time at which they were born, assume, for simplicity, that the 
user was born at midnight (i.e., 00:00:00) on that date. And assume that the current time is also 
midnight. In other words, even if the user runs the program at noon, assume that itâ€™s actually 
midnight, on the same date.
